# DashboardCraft
Dynamic Dashboard is a feature that allows users to create interactive and customizable dashboards with real-time data. With this feature, users can select and configure various widgets such as charts, tables, and graphs, and customise the layout and design of the dashboard to suit their needs. The data on the dashboard can be refreshed automatically, providing users with up-to-date information.
